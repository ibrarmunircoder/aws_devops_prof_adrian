# Project: Host a Static Website on AWS S3 via Cloudformation

## Module 1- Host a Static Website on AWS S3 via CloudFormation

### Overview:

This series of articles provide a step-by-step guide on how to deploy a basic static website to an Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) bucket using AWS CloudFormation. Starting with a simple architecture, each module identifies gaps and upcoming issues, and gradually introduces additional layers of complexity to resolve those issues. The steps involved registering a custom domain, creating S3 buckets, configuring Route 53, obtaining SSL/TLS certificate, creating an Origin Access Identity (OAI), setting up CloudFront distributions, and routing DNS traffic using Route 53. By leveraging the power of CloudFormation, developers can automate the infrastructure setup and deployment process, making it easier and more efficient to launch static websites.

In this module, we are going to deploy a simple static website to S3 bucket via AWS CloudFormation in three simple steps:
üëâ Step 1. Clone the React Project from the this [Link](https://github.com/ibrarmunircoder/react-aws-cfn-project.git)
üëâ Step 2. Create S3 bucket and its policy, and configure it to host a static website
üëâ Step 3. Build and deploy static website manually to newly created S3 bucket (optional, you can skip it and go to Module 2 for build automation)

AWS CloudFormation can be a great choice to provision and manage the complete infrastructure and AWS resources in a text file.

### Architecture:

The high-level architecture for our project is illustrated in the diagram below:

![Architecture](./images/image-1.png)

### Initial Setup:

Install required tools:
</br>
üëâ any IDE (personally I prefer Visual Studio Code)
</br>
üëâ git
üëâ Nodejs

### AWS Resources:

Here is the list of AWS resources that we are going to create:
</br>
üëâ S3 bucket
</br>
üëâ S3 bucket policy

### Why host static website on S3?
Why should you host your static content on S3? Let's break it down!

‚òëÔ∏è Firstly, you no longer need to allocate a specific amount of storage space or plan for it, as S3 buckets automatically scale to accommodate your needs.

‚òëÔ∏è Moreover, since S3 operates as a serverless service, you are relieved of the burden of managing and patching servers that store your files; you simply upload and retrieve your content.

‚òëÔ∏è Additionally, even if your application requires a server (such as a dynamic application), it can be smaller because it doesn't need to handle requests for static content.

### Step 1. Clone a React Application

Firstly, you need to clone the website by simply running the following command in terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibrarmunircoder/react-aws-cfn-project.git
```

Secondly, to run the application locally, go inside the cloned project folder and run two commands. First command will install depencies and second will start the project.

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

### Step 2. Create S3 bucket and its policy, and configure it to host a static website

In order to host our website on S3 bucket, let‚Äôs create and configure all required resources via CloudFormation.

1Ô∏è‚É£ The following piece of code helps to create a new S3 bucket and configure it to host a static website

```yml
Resources:
  chatGPTStaticWebsiteHostingBucket:
    Type: 'AWS::S3::Bucket'
    Properties:
      BucketName: 'chatgpt-static-website'
      WebsiteConfiguration:
        IndexDocument: index.html
        ErrorDocument: error.html
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Next step is to set S3 bucket permissions for website access.

When you configure a bucket as a static website, if you want your website to be public, you must disable block public access settings for the bucket and write a bucket policy that grants public read access.

That is why we are going to disable ACLs for our bucket under PublicAccessBlockConfiguration property and set the ownership of S3 bucket content to Object writer (i.e. AWS account that uploads an object owns the object and has full control over it).

```yaml
OwnershipControls:
    Rules:
        - ObjectOwnership: ObjectWriter
PublicAccessBlockConfiguration:
    BlockPublicAcls: false
    BlockPublicPolicy: false
    IgnorePublicAcls: false
    RestrictPublicBuckets: false
```

Basically we are disabling S3 Block Public Access settings to let users get a public access to the website.

![Block Access](./images/image-3.jpg)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Next step is to create an S3 bucket policy

We need to give a public read access to S3 bucket objects. Here is the policy:

```yaml
  bucketPolicy:
    Type: AWS::S3::BucketPolicy
    Properties:
      Bucket: !Ref chatGPTStaticWebsiteHostingBucket
      PolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Sid: 'PublicReadForGetBucketObjects'
            Effect: 'Allow'
            Principal: '*'
            Action: 's3:GetObject'
            Resource: !Join
              - ''
              - - 'arn:aws:s3:::'
                - !Ref chatGPTStaticWebsiteHostingBucket
                - '/*'
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ We are done with Resources, now let's output the website URL to make it easier to navigate using the link once the stack is built.

```yaml
Outputs:
  outputWebsiteURL:
    Value: !GetAtt 
      - chatGPTStaticWebsiteHostingBucket
      - WebsiteURL
    Description: Static website URL
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ We are ready to create and run CloudFormation stack based on our template.

I prefer to run the stack from AWS Console as it provides an end-to-end overview of a process flow. But you can always run a stack using the AWS CLI [(here is how)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/cfn-using-cli.html).


![Create](./images/image-4.png)
![Create](./images/image-5.png)

Once the stack built, you should see a newly created bucket and it's policy under Resources tab:

![Resources](./images/image-6.png)

### Step 3. Build and deploy static website manually to newly created S3 bucket

1Ô∏è‚É£ First, we need to build the production version of our React app locally.

Open Terminal for our app and run npm run build command

```bash
npm run build
```

A new build folder should be autogenerated with static content.

![build](./images/image-7.png)

2Ô∏è‚É£ In AWS Console navigate to our S3 bucket and upload all the files and folders from build folder:

![Upload](./images/image-8.png)
![Upload](./images/image-9.png)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Now refresh the website link - our React app should be up and running:

![Website](./images/image-10.png)


## Module 2- Automate the build of a Static Website Hosted on AWS S3 via CodeBuild and CloudFormation

### Overview:

In Module 1, we have created a simple static web app and hosted it on S3 bucket. However we took baby steps to deploy our static content to S3 bucket manually. Ideally we want to use a tool that would rebuild the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository and deploy built files to S3 bucket automatically.

In this module I'll show you how to automate the build and deployment via AWS CodeBuild in six simple steps:
</br>
üëâ Step 1. Create buildspec YAML file
</br>
üëâ Step 2. Provide CodeBuild with access to GitHub repo
</br>
üëâ Step 3. Configure how AWS CodeBuild builds your source code
</br>
üëâ Step 4. Create IAM role for CodeBuild project
</br>
üëâ Step 5. Run the CloudFormation stack
</br>
üëâ Step 6. Update frontend source code and watch how it will be built automatically

### Architecture:
The high-level architecture for our project is illustrated in the diagram below:

![Architecture](./images/image-11.jpg)

### AWS Resources:
Here is the list of AWS resources that we are going to create:
</br>
üëâ CodeBuild project
</br>
üëâ IAM role for CodeBuild project
</br>
üëâ GitHub Source Credential for CodeBuild project

### Step 1. Create buildspec YAML file

1Ô∏è‚É£ Install phase of buildspec file

Use the install phase only for installing packages in the build environment. In order to run the production build of our React web app, CodeBuild server needs Nodejs and npm installation.

```yaml
phases:
  install:
    runtime-versions:
      nodejs: 16
    commands:
      - echo "üì¶ installing packages..."
      - npm install --omit=dev
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Build phase of buildspec file

Use the build phase for commands that CodeBuild runs during the build.

```yaml
build:
    commands:
        - echo "üöß Starting compiling packages..."
        - npm  run build
        - echo "‚úÖ Build passed successfully."
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Artifacts of buildspec file

Artifacts represent information about where CodeBuild can find the build output and how CodeBuild prepares it for uploading to the S3 output bucket. Here we need to specify the path to build folder so that CodeBuild won't deploy a whole frontend project to S3 bucket but files for prod build only:

```yaml
artifacts:
  base-directory: 'build*'
  discard-paths: yes
  files:
    - '**/*'  
```

discard-paths helps to make sure to put all the files in the root folder instead of subfolder. In our case it will take all the files (including index.hmtl file) from build folder and put them in the root of S3 bucket.


### Step 2. Provide CodeBuild with access to GitHub repo
1Ô∏è‚É£ In order to access source code for frontend located on your GitHub account, CodeBuild needs some access privilege. The easiest and safest way to grand CodeBuild an access to GitHub is to create a personal access token.

Navigate to your GitHub and click your profile photo, then click Settings.

![Settings](./images/image-11.png)

In the left sidebar, scroll down and click Developer settings.

![Settings](./images/image-12.png)

In the left sidebar, under Personal access tokens, click Tokens (classic) (since Fine-grained tokens is in beta and might not be compatible with AWS CodeBuild yet), then click Generate new token.

![Settings](./images/image-13.png)

Select the scopes you'd like to grant this token.

![Token](./images/image-14.png)
![Token](./images/image-15.png)
![Token](./images/image-16.png)

Click Generate token. Copy the new token - we will need it while running a CloudFormation stack.

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

2Ô∏è‚É£ In CloudFormation template we are going to create a new AWS::CodeBuild::SourceCredential resource. Here we provide information about the credentials for a GitHub.

It is recommend to use AWS Secrets Manager to store our credentials. But for the sake of simplicity (let's take baby steps) we will pass a newly generated GitHub access token as a CloudFormation parameter for now.

```yaml
Parameters:
  paramPersonalGitHubAccessToken:
    Type: String
    MinLength: 10
    ConstraintDescription: Personal GitHub access token is missing
    Description: Provide your personal GitHub access token for 
    CodeBuild to access your GitHub repo

myCodeBuildSourceCredential:
    Type: AWS::CodeBuild::SourceCredential
    Properties:
      AuthType: PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN
      ServerType: GITHUB
      Token: !Ref paramPersonalGitHubAccessToken
```

### Step 3. Configure how AWS CodeBuild builds your source code

AWS::CodeBuild::Project resource configures how AWS CodeBuild builds your source code, such as where to get the source code and which build environment to use.

```yaml
myCodeBuildProject:
    Type: AWS::CodeBuild::Project
    Properties:
      Name: chatgpt-3-codebuild-for-website-hosting
      Description: CodeBuild project for automatically build of static website hosted on s3
```

Let's define where to get source code under source property

```yaml

myCodeBuildProject:
  Type: AWS::CodeBuild::Project
  Properties:
    Name: chatgpt-3-codebuild-for-website-hosting
    Description: CodeBuild project for automatically build of static website hosted on s3
    Source:
      Type: 'GITHUB'
      Location: 'https://github.com/ibrarmunircoder/react-aws-cfn-project.git'
      GitCloneDepth: 1
      Auth:
        Resource: !Ref myCodeBuildSourceCredential
        Type: OAUTH
```

In Triggers code settings for the CodeBuild project we want to enable AWS CodeBuild to begin automatically rebuilding the source code every time a code change is pushed to the repository. Basically we configured CodeBuild to listen to any git pushes to main branch to trigger the build.

```yaml
Triggers:
  Webhook: true
  FilterGroups:
    - - Type: EVENT
        Pattern: PUSH
      - Type: HEAD_REF
        Pattern: ^refs/heads/main # for feature branches use: ^refs/heads/feature/.*
```

In Environment code settings for the CodeBuild project we basically configured VM where CodeBuild is going to build the source code.

```yaml
Environment: # use Ubuntu standard v7
  Type: LINUX_CONTAINER
  ComputeType: BUILD_GENERAL1_SMALL
  Image: aws/codebuild/amazonlinux2-x86_64-standard:4.0
```

But how do you know which container, computer and image you need? Well, based on the code source programming language and framework you can check for Docker images [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html) and Available runtimes [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/available-runtimes.html).

As we have specified NodeJS v16 in our buildspec file, we can use either Amazon Linux 2 x86_64 standard:4.0 or Ubuntu standard:6.0.

![Image](./images/image-17.png)

Based on selected image I can get Image identifier from this [list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-env-ref-available.html).

![Image](./images/image-18.png)

In Artifacts code settings for the CodeBuild project we want to specify what to do with build files. In our case we want to put them to our S3 bucket that hosts the static website. Note, it's very important to disable encryption for our website files.

```yaml
Artifacts: # drop the build artifacts of S3 bucket that hosts static website
  Type: S3
  Name: '/' # store the artifact in the root of the output bucket
  Location: !Ref chatGPTStaticWebsiteHostingBucket
  EncryptionDisabled: True #disable the encryption of artifacts in a build to see html pages
```

In ServiceRole code settings for the CodeBuild project we need to create a new role with proper access - see Step 4.

```yaml
myCodeBuildProject:
  Type: AWS::CodeBuild::Project
  Properties:
    Name: chatgpt-3-codebuild-for-website-hosting
    Description: CodeBuild project for automatically build of static website hosted on s3
    ServiceRole: !Ref myCodeBuildProjectRole
```

### Step 4. Create IAM role for CodeBuild project

IAM role for CodeBuild project to get an access to S3 bucket where static website is hosted and to CloudWatch logs to stream the logs while building the project.


### Step 5. Run the CloudFormation stack

Now we are ready to create and run CloudFormation stack based on our template for CodeBuild.

Upload our template file to create a stack.

![Create](./images/image-19.png)

![PArameter](./images/image-20.png)


Note: Delete the existing codebuild source credentails before creating an stack

```bash
aws codebuild list-source-credentials --profile test-user
aws codebuild delete-source-credentials --arn arn:aws:codebuild:us-east-1:212446767488:token/github --profile test-user
```

## Important link (Access your source provider in CodeBuild)

```https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/access-tokens.html```

Start the build manually first time.

![Build](./images/image-21.png)

Let's navigate to our website. Remember, we have created our stack for S3 bucket - under Outputs tab you can find the link to our website (note, your link might be different from mine):

![Outputs](./images/image-22.png)

![S3](./images/image-23.png)

Voila! Our static website is up and running! It was built and deployed to S3 with the initial provisioning of our CodeBuild project.

![Website](./images/image-24.png)

### Step 6. Update frontend source code and watch how it will be built automatically

Now it's time to check out build automation.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Let's make a small change (it's totally up to you) in our source code for static website.

Let's make some changes in src\containers\src\header\Header.js file. I want to change GPT-3 to GPT-4

![code change](./images/image-25.png)

Push the changes into your repository. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ Once you pushed your changes to GitHub and navigate to our CodeBuild project on AWS Console, you should see that build was triggered automatically and its status is in progress:

![Build](./images/image-26.png)

3Ô∏è‚É£ Once build status has changed to Succeeded, go ahead and refresh your website link. You should see the code changes.

![Updated Website](./images/image-28.png)

Note, that all our logs for build were stored under newly created chatgpt-3-codebuild-for-website-hosting-CloudWatchLogs log group.

![CloudWatch](./images/image-27.png)


## Module 3. Use Your Custom Domain for Static Website Hosted on AWS S3 via Route 53 and CloudFormation

### Overview

In Module 1, we have created a simple static website and hosted it on S3 bucket. To access our website we used Amazon S3 website endpoint which looked like http://example.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com. However for users the link is too long and hard to remember. If you want your website appear legitimate to visitors you should use a custom domain name such as http://example.com.

## Architecture

The high-level architecture for our project is illustrated in the diagram below:

![Archiecture](./images/image-29.png)

### Why use domain name?
Why should you get a custom domain? Let's break it down!

‚òëÔ∏è Brand Superpowers: A custom domain name represents your brand and helps people easily recognize and remember you. Keep it consistent and unleash your brand's power.

‚òëÔ∏è Credibility Boost: With a custom domain, your website becomes the ultimate credibility booster. It shows visitors that you mean business and adds a professional touch.

‚òëÔ∏è Portability: With a custom domain, you can seamlessly move to different web hosting providers or website platforms while keeping the same web address.

### Create an S3 bucket for your root domain

To configure S3 bucket with Route 53 we need to make some adjustments.

üìå When you configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting, you must give the bucket the same name as the record that you want to use to route traffic to the bucket. For example, if you want to route traffic for example.com to an S3 bucket that is configured for website hosting, the name of the bucket must be example.com.


### Create Route 53 record set to route your traffic for your domain to S3 bucket

After you create a hosted zone for your domain, such as example.com, you need to create records to tell the Domain Name System (DNS) how you want traffic to be routed for that domain.

1Ô∏è‚É£ In our case we need to create a record to route internet traffic from root domain (such as example.com) to S3 bucket that hosts static website

![Route53](./images/image-30.png)

Remember, I have already created route53 hosted zone for my root domain. I will use this hosted zone to create records via cloudformation. I need Hosted zone id while creating records inside that hosted zone.

![Zone](./images/image-31.png)

The following piece of code helps to create a new record for S3 bucket for root domain:

```yaml
myRoute53RecordSetGroupForRootDomain:
  Type: 'AWS::Route53::RecordSetGroup'
  Properties:
    HostedZoneId: !Ref paramHostedZoneId
    RecordSets:
      - Name: ibrarmunir.co 
        Type: A
        AliasTarget:
            DNSName: !Sub s3-website-${AWS::Region}.amazonaws.com
            HostedZoneId: !FindInMap # note, that it is different from paramHostedZoneId - this hosted zone is for region that you created the bucket in!
              - RegionMap
              - !Ref 'AWS::Region'
              - S3HostedZoneId
```

üìå Note: HostedZoneId specified under AliasTarget is different from hosted zone id that we have created in Route 53 for our domain in Step 4. Hosted zone id for S3 is a magical alphanumeric ID provided by AWS team. It varies base on the region that you created the bucket in. That's why we used mapping to map S3 hosted zone id to region:

```yaml
Mappings:
  RegionMap: # based on https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints
    us-east-1:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z3AQBSTGFYJSTF
    us-west-1:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z2F56UZL2M1ACD
    us-west-2:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z3BJ6K6RIION7M
    eu-central-1:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z21DNDUVLTQW6Q
    eu-west-1:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z1BKCTXD74EZPE
    ap-southeast-1:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z3O0J2DXBE1FTB
    ap-southeast-2:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z1WCIGYICN2BYD
    ap-northeast-1:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z2M4EHUR26P7ZW
    sa-east-1:
      S3HostedZoneId: Z31GFT0UA1I2HV
```

See the whole list of hosted zone ids for S3 [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_website_region_endpoints).


### Run the CloudFormation stack

Now we are ready to create and run CloudFormation stack based on our template for Record Sets.
